<h1>Level 2</h1>

<h2>Phylogeny lab</h2>

<p>In this lab we will explore how to build trees, how to interpret them, and how we can use them to study some evolutionary problems. The lab is a mix of "games", quizzes, and demonstrations. You don't need any special software, just a web browser.</p>


<h3>Build a tree</h3>

<a href="https://vagabond-grateful-eyelash.glitch.me"><img src="images/bat.png"></a>

<p>To "warm up" we will use the <a href="https://vagabond-grateful-eyelash.glitch.me">"Build-a-Tree" game</a> to make some trees. The game gives you feedback on whether you have got the correct tree, and also shows you where different characters evolved on the tree.</p>

<h3>Making trees</h3>

<p>A quiz on making trees.</p>


<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>A quiz on character reconstruction.</p>


<h3>Tree thinking quiz 1</h3>

<p>Ok, so let's test whether you are now a fully-fledged "tree thinker". Take the "Tree thinking 1" test to find out (your instructor will give you the Menti code you need to take the test).</p>


<h3>Big trees</h3>

<p>For a change of pace, let's explore the tree of life using <a href="https://www.onezoom.org/life.html">OneZoom</a>. Some things to do


<h3>Phylogeography</h3>

<p>When we put DNA-based phylogenies onto a map we can sometimes see patterns. For example, a species may show clear geographic structure (for example, sequences from the same region may all cluster together), or we may see no evidence for geographic structure (for example if a population is panmictic and individuals are not restricted to just their local areas). </p>

<li>See the Menti quiz for questions</li>
</ul>


<h3>Historical Biogeography</h3>

<p>Is there any connection between this past movement of continents and the evolutionary relationships of the species that live on those continents?</p>

<li><a href="geojson-phylogeny-demo/class.html">Three trees</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Tree thinking quiz 2 (optional)</h3>

<p>If you have become infatuated with phylogenies, you can take the ultimate challenge:  "Tree thinking 2" (your instructor will give you the Menti code you need to take the test).</p>
