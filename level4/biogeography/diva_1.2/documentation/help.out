Biol., in press). The program can alsosummarize information in a set of reconstructions.The program was written by Fredrik Ronquist, Department of Zoology,Uppsala University, Villavaegen 9, SE-752 36 Uppsala, Sweden.DIVA is available for MacOS and 32-bit Windows systems. The program, Csource code, and a manual can be downloaded from the FTP-server ofUppsala University (ftp.uu.se). There are no warranties, neither expressnor implied. Use the program at your own risk!If you need help, type 'help;' or read the manual.>help;General information        DIVA is entirely controlled by commands typed from the keyboard or        read from a batch file. This gives the program flexibility, while        keeping it small and portable. When entering commands, it is necessary        to enter the full name of the command and finish with semicolon (;).        If it is not possible to fit a command with its arguments and options        in a single line, just finish the line with carriage return and con-        tinue typing on the next line. DIVA will not process the command until        semicolon ';' is encountered. Case is ignored in all input. A good way        of running DIVA is to prepare an ASCII (text-only) batch file using        your favourite word processor and then run it in DIVA with the 'proc'        command. The 'proc' command can also be used to read distribution        matrices and trees from NEXUS files, e.g., files created with MacClade.help [commands];        Prints help information about the specified command(s). If no command        is specified, the entire helpfile will be output.tree [treename] treespec;        This command sets a tree structure. 'Treename' is an optional label,        maximally 16 characters long. 'Treespec' is a treespecification in        NEXUS (parenthetical) format. The tree must be fully bifurcate and        contain less than 180 taxa. Taxa may be labelled using any combination        of printing characters except parentheses and comma, but a consecutive        series of integers between 1 and the number of taxa is recommended.        Examples:        >tree example ((1,2),(3,(4,5));        >tree (5,(2,(4,(1,3))));        >tree (apple,(pear,(1,(orange,banana))));        [If the labels in the last example do not correspond to previously        used taxon labels, new labels are set assuming that 'apple' is        taxon 1, 'pear' is taxon 2, '1' is taxon 3, etc.]distribution [+distributionname] distributionspec;        This command sets the distributions of a set of terminal taxa.        'Distributionname' is an optional label, maximally 16 characters long        The label must begin with '+', otherwise it will be interpreted as a        distribution. 'Distributionspec' is a list of the distributions of the        terminal taxa in terms of unit areas (max 15). Call the areas 'A', 'B',        'C', etc. and specify multiple-area distributions like 'BD' or 'ACE'.         Letters from A to O must be used. The distributions may be preceded by        numeric labels corresponding to taxon numbers.        Examples (two equivalent distribution specifications):        >distribution +test  A AB C;        >distribution        >3 c        >1 a        >2 ab;optimize [options];        Reconstructs the optimal distribution(s) at the ancestral nodes in        the last tree specified. Depending on the setting of parameters and        the difficulty of the problem, the optimization is either exact or        heuristic (signalledin output). The following options are available:    bound=x        Sets an upper bound x to the length of the optimal reconstruction.        This will in most cases speed up the optimization and increase the        chances of finding an exact solution. The value of x must be smaller        than 250, which is the default value.    maxareas=x        Constrains ancestral distributions to contain maximally x unit areas.        The value of x must be in the range from 2 to 15. The default value is        the total number of unit areas inhabited by the terminals. The speed        of the optimization is strongly dependent on the value of maxareas.        The smaller the value, the faster the optimization.    hold=x        Sets the maximum number of alternative reconstructions that will be        kept at a node. The value of x must be smaller than or equal to 32767.        The default setting is 1000. If x is set to 32767, the optimization        is guaranteed to be exact.    keep=x        Equivalent to hold=x.    age=x        Sets the age of the deepest node in the tree. This value is used in        the calculation of summary statistics if relative age classes are        chosen. The default value is 1.0.    weight=x        Sets the weight for a particular optimization to x, which must be        between 0 and 1. The weight is used in the calculation of summary        statistics. The default value is 1.0.    printrecs        Prints all alternative, equally optimal reconstructions. If printrecs        is not requested, output is restricted to a summary of the optimal        (most parsimonious) distributions at each nodeproc filename;        Changes control from screen to the batch file named 'filename'. The        batch file must specify a series of commands as they would have been        typed in from the keyboard. It must be a text file, and it must be in        the same folder as DIVA unless a correct file path is specified.        Control is returned to the screen console when 'proc --;', 'return;',        or the end of the file is reached. The 'proc' command can also be used        to process NEXUS files containing a presence/absence distribution        matrix and a tree specification. If the NEXUS file contains several        tree descriptions, only the last will be retained by DIVA.return;        If encountered in a batch file, returns control to the screen console.        If no return statement is encountered, the batch file is read until         the end of the file is reached.output filename;        Redirects output to the specified file. The file will be created in        the same folder as DIVA. DIVA can only create new files, it refuses        to overwrite existing files. The setting of echo determines whether        the output will be echoed to screen. If filename is '--', the output        file is closed and output is redirected to the screen console.echo [option];        Determines whether output will be echoed to screen. Three options        are available:    all        Causes all output to be echoed to screen (default setting).    status        Only status reports and error messages will be echoed to screen.    none        Nothing will be echoed to screen.showareas;        Displays the area labels (character labels) set in a NEXUS file.showtaxa;        Displays the taxon labels set in a NEXUS file or in a DIVA tree        description.reset [options];        Resets the counters for summary statistics. Six options are available:    ambiguous/unambiguous        Determines whether or not ancestral nodes for which the optimal dis-        tribution is ambiguous will be included in summary statistics. The        default setting is to include ambiguous ancestral distributions.    relative/absolute        Determines the type of time classes used. If absolute is specified        the node ages are used as is. If relative is specified, the node ages        are scaled to lie between 0 (for terminal nodes) and the age of the        group. The default setting is absolute.    classes=x        Defines the number of time classes used. The number must be smaller        than or equal to 5. The default value is 1.    interval=x        Sets the width of all time classes except the oldest one. The default        setting is 5 for absolute time classes and 0.5 for relative time        classes.    bounds n x1 [x2 .. xn]        Allows the user to specify time classes of unequal size. The number of        bound values is given by an integer n, which is followed by a list of        integer or floating point numbers (x1 etc.) defining the upper bound        of time classes from the youngest to the oldest. If bounds are not        given for all classes, the interval value is used to obtain the missing        bound values.    sumareas=x        Constrains the summation to only consider the first x areas. The value        of x must be in the range from 0 to 8. The default value is 0.nodeage nodeagespec;        Sets the ages of the ancestral nodes in a previously specified tree        according to the list of values in 'nodeagespec'. The order of the        ancestral nodes must follow the standard used by the program (see        manual for further information). If no nodeage command is issued,         the age of a node is calculated as the maximum number of nodes,        including the node itself, separating the node from any descendant        terminal.        Example (for a six-taxon tree with five ancestral nodes):        nodeage 0.02 0.03 0.10 1.0 2.3;sum [option];        Prints summary statistics for the optimizations performed since the        last 'reset' statement. One option:    areas=x        Restricts output of summary statistics to the first x areas. The value        of x must be smaller than or equal to the number of areas summed. The        default value is either the number of areas summed or the number of        areas encountered in the terminals, depending on which is smaller.rarefy filename1 output=filename2 areas=distributionspec [options];        This command is used to examine the effects of random extinction in        certain areas. First, the frequency of occurrence in the areas in        distributionspec is calculated for the optimize commands in the        specified batch file ('filename1'). Second, occurrences in the areas        in distributionspec are randomly deleted such that the frequencies        in the areas become equal. The result is written to a new batch file        ('filename2'). Options:    nrep=x;        Sets the number of replications to x. The default setting is 1.    seed=x;        Feeds the pseudorandom number generator the seed x. The default is 1.quit;        Terminates the program.>
