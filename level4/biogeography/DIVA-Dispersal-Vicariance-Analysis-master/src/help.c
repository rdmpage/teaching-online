	{"General information",
	"\tDIVA is entirely controlled by commands typed from the keyboard or",
	"\tread from a batch file. This gives the program flexibility, while",
	"\tkeeping it small and portable. When entering commands, it is necessary",
	"\tto enter the full name of the command and finish with semicolon (;).",
	"\tIf it is not possible to fit a command with its arguments and options",
	"\tin a single line, just finish the line with carriage return and con-",
	"\ttinue typing on the next line. DIVA will not process the command until",
	"\tsemicolon ';' is encountered in a line fed to the program by hitting",
	"\tcarriage return. Case is ignored in all input. A good way of running",
	"\tDIVA is to prepare a batch file (text only) using your favourite",
	"\tword processor and then run it in DIVA with the 'proc' command.",
	"\tThe 'proc' command can also be used to read distribution matrices",
	"\tand trees from NEXUS files, e.g., files created with MacClade.","",

	"\tcontain less than 180 taxa. Taxa may be labelled using any combination",
	"\tof printing characters except parentheses and comma, but a consecutive",
