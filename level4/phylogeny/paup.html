<h1>Using PAUP* (* Phylogenetic Analysis Using PAUP) to build trees</h1>

<p>These short exercises are designed to give you quick introduction to phylogenetic analysis using PAUP*. Work through these exercises. They introduce building trees using different methods, how to view those trees, and get some idea of their robustness.</p>

<h2>Starting PAUP*</h2>

<p>Download PAUP* from <a href="http://paup.phylosolutions.com/">http://paup.phylosolutions.com/</a>. You can also download the program here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="paup/paup4-setup.msi">paup4-setup.msi</a> Windows</li>
<li><a href="paup/PAUP_dev_icc.zip">PAUP_dev_icc.zip</a> Macs before MacOS 10.15 (Catalina)</li>
<li><a href="paup/paup4a168_osx.gz">paup4a168_osx.gz</a> Mac command line</li>
</ul>

<h3>Graphical version</h3>

<p>The graphical version of PAUP* is started by clicking on program icon:</p>

<p>Go to the file menu and open a data file. Once the data is read you can enter commands in the command line or using the menus. </p>

<p>All your results appear in the Display window.</p>

<h3>Command line version</h3>

<p>The command line version (only option on more recent Macs) can be started in a terminal window. If you are a Windows user but like the command line you can type commands into the bottom of the display window.</p>

 
<h3>How do I get help?</h3>

<p>To get a quick summary of commands type <code>help</code>. To get detailed help for a particular command type the name of the command followed by <code>?</code></p>

<h3>How do I get a tree?</h3>

<p>One quick way is to do a heuristic search. Type the command <code>hs</code> or go to the <b>Analysis</b> menu and choose <b>Heuristic Search</b>. Accept the default settings and click on the Search button.</p>

<h3>How do I get a neighbour-joining tree?</h3>

<p>Type the command <code>nj</code> or choose <b>Neighbor Joining/UPGMA</b> from the Analysis menu.

<h3>How do I change the optimality criterion?</h3>

<p>Use the set criterion command. For example:

<pre>
set criterion = parsimony

set criterion = likelihood
</pre>

or choose the corresponding option from the <b>Analysis</b> menu:</p>

<h3>How do I show my trees?</h3>

<p>The best tree (or trees) can be shown in the Display window issuing the command

<code>showtrees</code>.


 
<h3>How do I print my trees?</h3>

 
<p>In the graphical version you can go to the <b>Trees</b> menu and choose <b>Print tree</b>  or <b> Print NJ Tree…</b> (if you computed a neighbor joining tree. You will see a dialog box like this:</p>

 <img src="paup/print.png" width="400">

<p>PAUP can print the tree in a variety of styles. For now, just choose the <b>Plot type Phylogram</b> and click <b>Preview</b>. You will see something like this:</p>

  <img src="paup/preview.png" width="400">

<p>If you like what you see, click on the Done button. You will be taken back to the <b>Print NJ tree</b> dialog box shown above. Click <b>Print</b> and your tree will be printed.</p>

   
<p>If you’re not using the graphical version then you need to save the trees and print them using a tree viewing program such as <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/">Figtree</a>. To do this</p>

<ul>
<li>Enter the command <code>savetrees</code> (or <code>savetrees brlens=yes</code> if you want branch lengths)</li>
<li>PAUP* saves the tree file</li>
<li>Open this file in Figtree  (e.g., by double clicking on it). You can print the tree (or trees).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Part 1: Building trees</h2>

<p>Open the data file <a href="paup/Hominoid mtDNA.nex">Hominoid mtDNA.nex</a> in PAUP*. Build a parsimony tree using a heuristic search. View it in the display window (<code>showtrees</code>). If you wish, save it to a file (<code>savetrees</code>) then view that file in Figtree (or print it from within PAUP).</p>

<p>For small numbers of sequences you can compute the parsimony score for all possible trees. Use the command <code>alltrees</code> to do this.</p>

<p>Q: What does the plot of tree lengths tell you? How confident are you that the shortest tree is the true tree?</p>

<p>Change the optimality criterion to likelihood (<code>set criterion = likelihood</code>). Find the maximum likelihood tree (<code>hs</code>). Is it the same as the parsimony tree?</p>


<h2>Part 2: Trees with confidence</h2>

<p>The bootstrap is a commonly used way of assessing how robust a tree is.</p> 

<p>Set the optimality criterion to parsimony and run a bootstrap analysis (bootstrap). What do the numbers on the branches mean?  What can you say about the three alternative hypotheses concerning relationships among the African apes?</p> 


<p>Change the optimality criterion to likelihood, and redo the bootstrap. How do the results compare to parsimony?</p>
