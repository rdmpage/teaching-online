<h2>Google Earth exercises</h2>

<div class="example">
<b>Where are new species of frogs found?</b>
<p>The KML file <a href="data/frogs.kml">frogs.kml</a> contains the locations of recently described frog species (obtained by data mining the Amphibia Species of the World web site). Load this file into Google Earth. Where are the new frogs species being found? Are there any records you might be suspicious of?</p>

<p>Now that we know where the new species of frogs are being found, we can ask whether these new species in conservation areas or not (presumably being in a conservation area increases there chances of avoiding extinction). To answer this question we need to be able to plot conservation area on Google Earth.</p>

<p><img style="float:right;" src="images/protectedplanet-twitter.png" width="48">One source of KML files for Google Earth is <a href="http://www.protectedplanet.net/">protectedplanet.net</a>. If you go to the site and either browse or search for protected areas you can download a KML file of a conservation area (you have to sign in to download data).</p>

<p>As a starting point, here is the <a href="data/rdmpage-ranomafana-1327355500838.kmz">KML file</a> for the <a href="http://protectedplanet.net/sites/Ranomafana_National_Park" target="_new">Ranomafana National Park</a> in Madagascar. If you download this file and open it in Google Earth you will be able to see whether any recently described frogs are in that protected area.</a>

<div class="example">
<b>Comparing two sets of data about a species distribution</b>

<p>GBIF data comes from museum collections and observations of living organisms. Inevitably this data will be affected by sampling bias (organisms won't be found where people haven't looked) as well as digitisation bias (not every museum collection or database of observations). There may also be data that hasn't been added to GBIF. In this exercise we will explore <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> as a source of distributional data. Flickr contains a wealth of images of organisms, many tagged by their scientific name. Many of these images are geotagged (e.g., they were taken with a camera or phone that has GPS built in), which means we can place them on a may. Given that Flickr exports KML files, it is easy to add these images to Google Earth and compare them with GBIF data.</p>

<p>As an example, we can get images for the spider <i>Leucauge magnifica</i> by searching Flickr for the tag "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/leucaugemagnifica/" target="_new">leucaugemagnifica</a>". Grab the search results as a KML file (you should see a link near the bottom of the page, or <a href="data/leucaugemagnifica.kml">local copy here</a>) and load this in to Google Earth.</p>

<p>Now go to the GBIF data portal (<a href="http://www.gbif.org" target="_new">http://www.gbif.org</a>) and search for <i>Leucauge magnifica</i> (if you are impatient then click on <a href="http://www.gbif.org/species/2151499/" target="_new">http://www.gbif.org/species/2151499/</a> or grab a <a href="data/taxon-placemarks-2151499.kml">local copy of the KML file here</a>). 
</p>

<p>Are the Flickr photos within the distributional range from GBIF? If not, how would you interpret this?</p>

<h2>Evaluate online maps</h2>

<p>The following web sites use maps to display biodiversity information.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.protectedplanet.net/en">Protected Planet</a></li>
<li><a href="https://journalmap.org">JournalMap</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gbif.org">GBIF</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mol.org">Map of Life</a></li>
<li><a href="https://inaturalist.org">iNaturalist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.globalforestwatch.org">Global Forest Watch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Visit these web sites and evaluate them using the following criteria</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to search by a region</li>
<li>Ease of downloading data</li>
<li>Customisability of the map</li>
<li>Overall interest</li>
</ul>
